# audit

Trigger: verify a completed change without modifying files.

Scope:
- Read the stated intent, acceptance criteria, and diff.
- Check the change against the actual failure mode or requirement.
- Run the smallest relevant verification command.
- Report `PASS`, `FAIL`, or `INCONCLUSIVE` with evidence.

Rules:
- The agent must not edit files while auditing.
- Do not trust "tests pass" unless the agent reruns or inspects the evidence.
- If the audit fails, cite file and line where possible.
- If intent is missing and the diff makes surprising choices, ask for intent instead of inventing it.

Output:

```text
